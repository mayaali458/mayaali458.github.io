			<p>As a small drinking water systems assistant at PWBS, I gained valuable hands-on experience in the operation and maintenance of water treatment systems. My primary responsibilities included collecting water samples, performing chemical and microbiological tests, and inspecting equipment at several small water systems. I assisted operators with assessing treatment performance, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Through completing daily logs and generating monthly reports, I improved my technical writing abilities. My time at PWBS provided an excellent opportunity to learn about real-world drinking water system operations and strengthened my passion for providing safe, sustainable water solutions.</p>
