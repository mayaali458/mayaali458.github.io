			<p>As a small drinking water systems assistant at PWBS, I gained valuable hands-on experience in the operation and maintenance of water treatment systems.</p>
			<p>My primary responsibilities included:</p>
			<p>Collecting water samples from various sampling points at small water systems according to a regular schedule. I performed chemical and microbiological tests on these samples in an accredited laboratory.</p>
			<p>Collaborated with health inspectors and engineers to assess conditions and identify improvement opportunities, mastering diligent documentation practices while navigating on-site complexities.</p>
			<p>Maintaining accurate daily system logs to track flows, chlorine residuals, turbidity readings, and other parameters. I compiled these into monthly summary reports.</p>
			<p>Conducting routine maintenance tasks such as filter backwashing, chlorinator maintenance, and UV lamp replacements to maintain proper operation.</p>
			<p>Responding to any unexpected changes in water quality by promptly collecting special samples for analysis.</p>
			<p> Through professional collaborations and oversight of multifaceted fieldwork, I strengthened critical thinking, communication, and project leadership skills essential for tackling intricate engineering initiatives. My time at PWBS provided an excellent opportunity to learn about real-world drinking water system operations and strengthened my passion for providing safe, sustainable solutions.</p>
