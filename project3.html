	<h1>Environmental Impact Assessment</h1>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="projects-col">
			<p>The goal of this project was to conduct a preliminary environmental impact assessment on the proposed Melancthon "mega-quarry" in Ontario, Canada. The assessment analyzed the potential impacts of the 937 hectare quarry on the natural and human environment, including impacts to water, wildlife, vegetation, nearby communities, the economy, and First Nations groups.</p>
			<p>The assessment compared the proposed mega-quarry to alternatives like a smaller quarry with mitigation measures and not building any quarry at all. It summarized viewpoints from various stakeholders like government agencies, environmental groups, and residents. Critical impact analyses focused on topics like effects on water quality, loss of farmland, and risks to wildlife.</p>
			<p>Based on the findings, it was concluded that the mega-quarry's negative impacts outweighed potential benefits. The report recommended against developing the mega-quarry as proposed due to unacceptable impacts on the natural environment, nearby communities, and First Nations rights. Alternate aggregate sources like marine extraction were suggested instead to meet demand.</p>
			<p>This project provided an opportunity to apply concepts from class in a real-world scenario. It enhanced skills in impact assessment, stakeholder consultation, critical analysis, and technical writing. Working collaboratively to deliver a comprehensive assessment within time constraints was a valuable team experience. Overall, the project reaffirmed the importance of thoroughly evaluating sustainability and social justice when proposing major resource developments.</p>
